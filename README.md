At first, I created a new Azure account for myself using my HAMK student ID,"amk1008039@student.hamk.fi". To have more credits to use, requested Azure for students credits from Microsoft. After logging in with my HAMK email ID to Azure portal, added an Azure for students subscription. Once I have been accepted into my Azure for Students subscription I created a new virtual machine for my self. I went to the homepage of my portal and created a new resource, a virtual machine selecting Marketplace from Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS gen 2 Server published by Canonical. Named my machine logically. E.g. Ubuntu1-tja-NEur-B1s. Set the machine virtual machine size to Standard_B2ls_v2. Specified the public ip to which I get allowed SSH traffic. Createed
myself a username and ssh key. Created a new resource group for the machine and a subnet to place the machine in.
